# Google/Spotify OAuth2 implicit grant

The example in the `google` folder is taken from [Using OAuth 2.0 for JavaScript Web Applications](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/auth/client-side-web-apps).

In either `google` or `spotify`, just copy `config.sample.js` as `config.js` and replace the client ID and redirect URI.
